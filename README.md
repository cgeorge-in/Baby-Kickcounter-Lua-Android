What does it do?
The app helps you monitor your baby's health during the third trimester of the pregnancy. 

How does it do it?
The app lets you conduct sessions where you can record a kick by a push of a button, whenever the baby kicks. The app has its own analyzer engine keeping track of your entire history of sessions with the app. And, it gives you a complete statistics at the end of a session.

Why should I keep a track of my baby's kicks?
Pregnancy is the most beautiful and intimate journey of a mother with her baby. This is the time when you two form an indescribable bond. The first time you feel your baby's life assuring kick is really when you feel the miracle that is you and in you. 
Baby kick counting has proven life saving in many cases. 

On detecting low activity, parents are advised to visit their doctor without delay.

That is why we created kicky, a life saving app developed by parents for parents to help keep track of your baby's little kicks and movements. 
  
When and how frequently should I monitor these movements?
Most women feel their baby's movements around 18-20 weeks of pregnancy, but this varies on a case to case basis. Some women feel these movements much later than this.
The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that you time how long it takes you to feel 10 kicks, flutters, swishes, or rolls. Ideally, you want to feel at least 10 movements within 2 hours. You will likely feel 10 movements in less time than that.
